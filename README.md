# Natural Language Processing Application with Django

## Introduction
  Sentiment analysis, a vital application of Natural Language Processing (NLP), aims to determine the sentiment expressed in text, whether positive, negative, or neutral. With its wide-ranging applications in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and brand reputation management, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding public opinions and emerging trends. Django, a powerful Python web framework, provides an ideal platform for seamlessly integrating sentiment analysis capabilities into web-based applications.
  By leveraging Django's versatility and extensive ecosystem, developers can build intelligent and interactive applications that process and analyze natural language input in real time, delivering accurate sentiment predictions. This integration involves applying NLP techniques to preprocess text data, selecting an appropriate sentiment analysis model capable of multiclass classification and contextual understanding, training the model using labeled data, and integrating it seamlessly into a Django application. The result is a web application that enables real-time sentiment analysis, empowering organizations to gain valuable insights and automate sentiment analysis tasks.

## Objectives
  • Apply knowledge in machine learning to develop automation solutions utilizing NLP techniques.
  • Implement the necessary steps involved in building NLP-based applications, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
  • Evaluate the performance of the created sentiment analysis model using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.
  • Integrate the trained sentiment analysis model seamlessly into a Django application, allowing users to input text and obtain real-time sentiment analysis results (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Instructions
  1. Preprocess the text data by performing the following steps:
    • Clean the data by removing punctuations and any irrelevant characters.
    • Eliminate stopwords (commonly used words with little contextual meaning).
    • Perform feature engineering if necessary, such as extracting additional relevant features from the text.
    • Generate a feature vector representation of the text data suitable for the chosen model.
  2. Choose a model that satisfies the following criteria:
    • Capable of performing multiclass classification to handle sentiment analysis tasks.
    • Can effectively handle sequences and understand contextual information.
    • Demonstrates good performance against the chosen evaluation metrics.
    • Possesses mathematical coherence suitable for sentiment analysis implementations.
  3. Train the selected model using the preprocessed data and save it to a file format (such as joblib, pickle, or other compatible types) for later use in exporting the model.
  4. Integrate the created model into a Django application that allows users to input a text and obtain sentiment analysis results (positive, negative, or neutral). Ensure seamless integration between the Django application and the trained model to enable real-time predictions.
  5. Prepare a concise presentation covering the following aspects:
    • Provide a brief introduction to the project, explaining its purpose and goals.
    • Describe the experimental methodology used, including details on how the data was preprocessed and the rationale behind choosing the specific model.
    • Present the results of the experimentations, including a comparison of performance metrics for each iteration or improvement made.
    • Conduct a demonstration of the Django application, showcasing its functionality and how it accurately predicts sentiment based on user input.
